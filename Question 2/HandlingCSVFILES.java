/*
 * How will you tackle the challenge above?
 * 
 * As the Above question states that the file is csv and will be going to be kind of 3x3.
 * So now i will be creating a hard coded program to handle the above program
 * 
 * 
 * What type of errors you would you check for?
 * 1. FileNotFound
 * 2. Unable to Retrive Data
 * 3. File is of Small Size then 3x3
 * 
 * 
 * How might a user break your code?
 * 1. By giving a big csv file then 3x3
 * 2. By giving a small csv file then 3x3
 * 3. Changing the Name of File
 * 4. Changing ',' to something else.
 * 5. Try to Perform new Operations
 *
